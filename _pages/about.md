### About Me

I am currently a Master's student at the University of Arizona's (UA) [Human Language Technology](https://linguistics.arizona.edu/ms-hlt) program. In 2021, I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) with my B.A. in Linguistics. My background involves a mix of linguistics, computer science, and customer service, which has given me a unique perspective on how technology and language intersect. I enjoy getting to know people and helping them navigate through technical challenges. My passion is creating and identifying accessible solutions for non-technical audiences and underserved communities. I am excited about projects that work on ensuring technology is not only innovative, but approachable and empowering.         

### My Background

#### Linguistics 
I began my academic career in 2015 at UBC. Uncertain of what subject I wanted to specialize in, I enrolled in a variety of different courses in my first semester including a first-year linguistics course titled "Challenging Langauge Myths". The material was fun and engaging, involving a weekly new "language myth" to discuss and bust. Topics ranged from more traditional linguistic topic (is there such a thing as "good" or "bad" grammar?) to more modern ones (are emojis and text-speech ruining language?). Upon finishing the course, I enrolled fully into linguistics credits for my next semester and declared a Linguistics major for my second year. In my fourth year, I joined a mixed graduate/undergraduate year-long field method course in which we were paired with an elder from the Secwepemc community to research and document linguistic patterns or phenomena for their language, Secwepemctsin. I spent the first part of the year working on past and perfect tense markers with a colleague and then spent the second part of the year working on deictic markers and demonstatives. As part of this research, I gave a presentation on my findings to the Salish Working Group at UBC and to a class of Secwepemc learners, researchers, and elders at Simon Fraser University (SFU). I spent an additional six months after my degree concluded continuing to do Secwepemctsin langauge work by annotating and organizing data and authoring pedagogical resources such as storyboards and grammar exercises under a Jacobs Research Fund (JRF) group grant.   

#### Computer Science & NLP 

In the second year of my Linguistics degree, I attended a department talk on computational linguistics. The talk focused around what NLP was, where it was headed, and if computationally focused classes should be included in the linguistics department curriculum. I left the talk feeling excited about the possibilities and implications of the technology, but it was not until my fourth year that I picked up computer science courses. Having spent most of my degree in a humanities curriculum, I initially struggled with some of the more math-based concepts. Despite the difficulty, I enjoyed the straight-forward solutions and satisfaction of code compiling successfully. Upon the completion of my degree I began working at Global Relay, where I worked as a Systems Analyst. I created and ran SQL queries, managed and processed datasets, and worked with development, product, and UI teams on testing and suggesting product features. Though I enjoyed my role, I was still curious about NLP and looking to learn more CS skills. This led me to apply for the UA MSc HLT program, which I enrolled in for Fall of 2023. Through the program, I have learned about topics such as speech technology, neural networks, natural language processing and the algorithms that power them. I have gotten hands-on experience with a variety of programming languages and popular tools or packages used in the technology industry, such as NLTK and PyTorch. As part of my MSc, I completed an internship at an AI solutions company where I was building AI agents, learning about different agentic workflows, and working with OpenAi and LangChain packages.
